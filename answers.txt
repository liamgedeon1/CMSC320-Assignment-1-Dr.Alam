Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Git is an easy way to share code with others. It allows for multiple 
people to work on the same project, in this situation it allows students to 
share their code with their professor for review, and allows you to see 
multiple variations of code as a project progresses. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it 
might help

Answer: Data science could be applied to all sorts of fields, genuinely all 
fields. One example of a field is the transportation industry. Airlines, trains,
busses all have tons of data that needs to be tracked, and data science is the 
most efficent way to do so.


Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging is taking two open branches and combining them. Rebasing is 
changing the base of your branch from one comitt to another.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I have mainly worked with software engineering and not at all with the 
data side of things. I hope to branch into the data side at some point in my 
career as it is in high demand and with all of the different tools to manipulate
and display data, it is a very intriuging field to me. I am going into this 
class with no data science experience, so in terms of skills to improve on, it
is essentially all of them.
